# NetZero

## Project Description

NetZero is a blockchain-based carbon credit marketplace that tokenizes environmental impact through NFTs. The platform enables organizations and individuals to issue, trade, and retire carbon credits in a transparent and verifiable manner. Each carbon credit represents a verified amount of CO2 offset from environmental projects like reforestation, renewable energy, or carbon capture initiatives.

Built on Ethereum using Solidity smart contracts, NetZero leverages the immutability and transparency of blockchain technology to create trust in the carbon offset market while preventing double-counting and fraud.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to democratize access to carbon offsetting and create a transparent, efficient marketplace for environmental impact. NetZero aims to:

- **Bridge the gap** between environmental projects and those seeking to offset their carbon footprint
- **Eliminate fraud** and double-counting in carbon credit markets through blockchain immutability
- **Incentivize environmental projects** by providing a direct monetization pathway
- **Enable micro-offsetting** for individuals and small businesses
- **Create transparency** in carbon offset claims and project verification

## Key Features

### üå± **Carbon Credit Tokenization**
- Convert verified CO2 offsets into tradeable NFTs
- Each token represents a specific amount of CO2 offset with full provenance
- Immutable record of project details, location, and issuance date

### üîç **Project Verification System**
- Only verified environmental projects can issue carbon credits
- Transparent verification process managed by authorized validators
- Public registry of approved projects

### ‚ôªÔ∏è **Retirement Mechanism**
- Permanent retirement of credits to prevent double-counting
- Automatic burning of NFTs upon retirement
- Individual and global offset tracking

### üìä **Transparency & Tracking**
- Real-time tracking of total CO2 offset globally
- Individual user offset history
- Public verification of all transactions

### üõ°Ô∏è **Security Features**
- Built with OpenZeppelin's battle-tested contracts
- ReentrancyGuard protection
- Comprehensive access controls
